# 51percent-attack
This project simulates a 51% attack on a blockchain using Rust. The goal is to demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities of a blockchain network when a malicious entity gains majority control over the mining or validating process. The simulation helps in understanding the dynamics of such attacks and their impact on blockchain security
